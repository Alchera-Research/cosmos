# Trivia (the background stories)
```
I wouldn't have started this project 
if there was a solution that could solve the repetitive work while developing back-end APIs.

I can't wait anymore for someone to make it, because I need it now.

## Motivation And Background

Since I worked for several companies, I found some repetitive patterns while developing back-end systems.  
To save time, I generalized, abstracted and simplified these tasks by creating a kind of framework.  
I have used all my accumulated knowledge and experience to solve this problem.  

<br/>

I have to solve the same tasks again from scratch whenever I move to a different company.  
To me, repetitive work is really boring, and I really don't want to do it again and again.  
I do not want to waste my life doing that.  

At the present, due to solution requirements, I have to add many new features to this framework.
But I cannot do this alone.  

My current team at Alchera Inc. does not have enough resources for that. (on Oct 28, 2023)  

But I believe nobody ever has "enough" resources when they are doing anything.  
Nobody.  

<br>

I thought deeply about this situation.
There were only two options:
- (1) Start an open-source project and develop this framework with the world, or 
- (2) just complain about resources that I cannot get and blame the company management.
 
As you can safely assume, we have decided to start this open-source project.
